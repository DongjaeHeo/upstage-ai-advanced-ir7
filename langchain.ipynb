      "Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) are a type of fat that is essential for human health. They are considered \"essential\" because the body cannot produce them on its own, so they must be obtained through the diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Importance of PUFAs\n",
      "Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Supporting brain development and function: PUFAs are a major component of brain cell membranes and are essential for cognitive function, mood regulation, and memory.\n",
      "2. Reducing inflammation: PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce inflammation in the body, which can contribute to chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.\n",
      "3. Improving heart health: PUFAs can help to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels, which can reduce the risk of heart disease.\n",
      "4. Supporting immune function: PUFAs are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, which helps to protect the body against infections and diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Sources of PUFAs\n",
      "Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids can be found in a variety of foods, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Nuts and seeds: Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are all good sources of PUFAs.\n",
      "2. Fatty fish: Fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acids, a type of PUFA.\n",
      "3. Avocados: Avocados are a good source of monounsaturated fats, which are a type of PUFA.\n",
      "4. Plant oils: Oils like canola, soybean, and olive oil are high in PUFAs.\n",

      "Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\n",
      "Agent System Overview#\n",
      "In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning\n",
      "\n",
      "Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\n",
      "Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n",

      "Human: What is Task Decomposition?\n",
      "AI: System: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\n",
      "Component One: Planning#\n",
      "A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\n",
      "Task Decomposition#\n",
      "Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n",
      "Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finite context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\n",
      "The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\n",
      "Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n",
      "Human: What is Task Decomposition?\n",
      "\n",
      "Task decomposition is a process in which a complex task is broken down into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This approach allows for a more efficient and organized approach to problem-solving, as it enables individuals or systems to focus on specific aspects of the task at hand. In the context of AI and LLMs, task decomposition can be achieved through various techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which involve prompting the model to think step-by-step and explore multiple reasoning possibilities. This process can help the model better understand and solve complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subtasks.\n",
      "Human: What are common ways of doing it?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several common ways to perform task decomposition in the context of AI and LLMs. One approach is to use simple prompting techniques such as \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" to instruct the model to break down a task into smaller steps. Another approach is to use task-specific instructions, such as \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, which can help the model understand the specific requirements of the task at hand. Additionally, human inputs can also be used to guide the model in breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human: What are the challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition?\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term planning and task decomposition can be challenging for LLMs due to several factors. Firstly, LLMs may struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error. Secondly, the restricted context capacity of LLMs limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses, which can hinder the model's ability to effectively plan and execute tasks. Finally, the representation power of vector stores and retrieval is not as powerful as full attention, which can limit the model's ability to effectively explore the solution space and make informed decisions.\n"
